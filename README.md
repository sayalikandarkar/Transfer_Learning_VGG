# Transfer_Learning_VGG

## In this project, I have tried to generate an image using content of one image and by deriving style of another image.

## We don't always have the computational power to build models from the scratch, so we can use pretrained models in such case. In this project, I have used the VGG19 pretrained model.

### Download the python file and feed the images and see the magic :)
